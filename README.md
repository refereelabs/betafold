### A physics engine simulating the behavior of a single particle 
---

**betafold** is a physics engine designed to simulate the behavior of a single particle using data learned and output determined by processing via a transformer deep learning architecture.

The underlying **betafold** model and engine is developed in C++ using [libtorch](https://pytorch.org/features/) with bindings in Python via [PyBind](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The training data is generated using the [Nvidia PhysX](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX) engine.
